# Product Recommendation System using TF-IDF and Cosine Similarity

## Overview

This repository contains a simple product recommendation system implemented in Python using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and cosine similarity. The code utilizes the `pandas` library for data manipulation and scikit-learn for TF-IDF calculations.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/recommendation-system.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
    ```bash
    cd recommendation-system
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Run the Recommendation Script**:
    - Open and edit `recommendation_script.py` to customize the input data or adjust parameters.
    - Execute the script:
        ```bash
        python recommendation_script.py
        ```

## Project Structure

- `recommendation_script.py`: Main script for recommending similar products.
- `data/`: Directory for storing input datasets.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Customization

- Replace the sample data in `data/sample_data.csv` with your own dataset.
- Modify the script to suit your specific requirements, such as adjusting the number of recommendations or changing input data columns.

## Important Notes

- Ensure your dataset is well-structured with the required columns.
- This code assumes a basic understanding of Python, pandas, and recommendation systems.
- Feel free to reach out for any assistance or clarifications.
